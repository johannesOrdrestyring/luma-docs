- **Free access** to Luma during the pilot
- **Direct line** to the development team
- **Influence** over what features we build next
- **Priority support** when things don't work

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the pilot, we want to:

1. **Replace your current system** — You're using Luma, not Excel
2. **Find your "aha moment"** — The feature that makes you go "wow"
3. **Identify what's missing** — Tell us what you need
4. **Make you angry if we turn it off** — That's when we know we've built something valuable

## How to Join

Interested in joining the pilot? Here's how:

1. **Email us** at [luma@aceve.se](mailto:luma@aceve.se)
2. **Tell us about your business** — What do you do? How many people?
3. **Describe your current pain** — What's broken about your admin today?
4. **We'll schedule a call** — 15 minutes to see if it's a good fit

## FAQ

### Is it free?
Yes, during the pilot period. We haven't decided on pricing yet.

### What if Luma breaks my accounting?
During alpha, we use Fortnox in "read-only" mode. Nothing syncs to your real accounting until you're ready.

### How much time do I need to commit?
About 30 minutes per week for feedback calls. Plus using Luma for your daily work.

### What happens after the pilot?
You'll get priority access to the full product when we launch. Early pilot customers will get special pricing.

### Is my data safe?
All data is stored in Sweden (Azure Sweden Central). We follow GDPR. We don't sell or share your data.
