## What is Luma?

Luma is an AI-built system for small trades businesses that are fed up with Excel chaos, clunky ERPs, and admin stealing their evenings.

You log jobs, time, and materials on your phone. Luma takes care of the rest: invoicing, payments, follow-ups, and financial overview. Everything syncs automatically with accounting systems like Fortnox.

**In short:**
- On the go
- Less admin
- Full control
- More time for real work (and a life outside the van)
