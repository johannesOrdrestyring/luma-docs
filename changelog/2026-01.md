### 📋 Luma Vision Documented

Published our product vision and design principles.

#### Key Documents

- **Luma Discovery**: Full product vision with user personas, core flows, and design principles
- **UX North Star**: "Can a first-time business owner use this on day one, alone, from their phone, in 2 minutes?"
- **Core Flows**: Something Happened, Did a Job, Bought Something, Got Paid, Help Me

#### Design Principles

1. **Event-based**: "Something happened" not menus and modules
2. **Guided**: AI suggests next steps — users never have to think
3. **Mobile-first**: One hand, few taps, done
4. **Invisible**: If the user wonders "what do I do now?" — we failed
