### 🐛 Calendar Sync Now Fetches All Events

Previously, syncing your calendar would only import the first ~60 events, which often meant your future appointments were missing. This has been fixed - calendar sync now retrieves all your events within the sync window (30 days past to 90 days future).

#### What Changed
- Calendar sync now fetches all pages of events from Google, Outlook, and Apple calendars
- You'll see all your upcoming appointments, not just a partial list
- Improved logging shows exactly how many events were synced

### 🗓️ Professional Resource Calendar

Your schedule page now features a powerful new calendar built on Bryntum Calendar, designed for field service teams that need to manage multiple technicians.

#### What Changed
- New resource view showing all team members side-by-side
- Filter by employee to focus on specific schedules
- Calendar sources dropdown to show/hide Google, Outlook, or Apple events
- Sync status indicator shows when your calendars were last updated
- Undo/redo support for accidental changes
- PDF export for printing weekly schedules

### 📱 Edit External Calendar Events

You can now edit events that came from your Google, Outlook, or Apple calendar directly in the Luma app. Changes automatically sync back to your original calendar.

#### What Changed
- Tap any external calendar event to view details
- Use the new Edit button to modify time, title, or location
- Your changes push back to Google/Outlook/Apple automatically
- A sync indicator shows when changes are being sent to your calendar
