## February 24, 2026

### 👤 Create Customer — Now a Bottom Sheet

Creating a new customer now opens as a slide-up bottom sheet instead of a full-screen modal. It matches the same pattern as "Did a Job" — with a sticky swipe button at the bottom and proper keyboard handling.

#### What Changed
- FAB on the Customers tab opens a bottom sheet instead of navigating to a modal screen
- Sticky "Svep för att skapa" swipe button stays visible above the keyboard
- Keyboard automatically adjusts — text fields at the bottom of the form stay visible
- Customer form supports embedding in bottom sheets (new `noScrollWrapper` + `hideFooter` modes)

---

### 📞 Call Log — Customer Search & Inline Creation

The "Log Call" sheet now has a proper customer picker with search and the ability to create new customers without leaving the flow.

#### What Changed
- Search bar with debounced search + recent customers list when selecting "Existing customer"
- "Create new customer" button opens an inline form with Roaring.io company lookup
- New contacts can be saved as customers with one tap ("Spara som ny kund")
- FAB on the Call Logs tab now directly opens the Log Call sheet
- Swipe button is now sticky at the bottom (matching "Did a Job" pattern)

---

### ⌨️ Job Detail — Keyboard No Longer Covers Notes

When editing the Notes (Work Done / Remarks) fields on a job, the keyboard covered the text input so you couldn't see what you were typing. Now the view scrolls up automatically.

#### What Changed
- `KeyboardAvoidingView` wraps the scrollable content area
- Notes section auto-scrolls into view when tapping the edit button
- Save/Cancel buttons work without dismissing the keyboard first
- Interactive keyboard dismiss — drag down to close

---

### 📝 Quote Versioning

Quotes now support version history. When you revise a quote, the previous version is preserved and a new version is created — so you always have a record of what was sent.

#### What Changed
- New "Create New Version" action on quote detail
- Version number and parent quote tracked in the database
- Quote detail shows version history with links to previous versions
- Backend: new Prisma migration for `parentQuoteId` and `versionNumber` fields

### 🎨 Sprout Design System — Web

- Ultra-soft shadow system (2-4% opacity) for subtle depth

---

### ⌨️ Keyboard No Longer Covers Input Fields

Tapping a text field at the bottom of a form (like the description field when creating a job) no longer gets hidden behind the keyboard. The app now auto-scrolls to keep the focused field visible.

#### What Changed
- Fixed across all 12 form screens (job creation, quotes, customer forms, invoices, settings, and more)
- Uses native iOS auto-scroll instead of manual offset calculations
- Interactive keyboard dismiss — drag down to close the keyboard

---

### 🕐 New Date & Time Pickers

#### What Changed
- Native iOS date/time spinner with Sprout design styling
- Tap to expand, "Klar" button to confirm
- Swedish locale formatting (e.g., "tis 25 feb 2026")
- Side-by-side start/end time pickers for calendar events

---

### 🔄 Document Re-Analyze Now Works

Previously, re-analyzing a document would silently fail if it had been analyzed before (even if the first attempt returned empty results). This is now fixed — re-analyze always processes the document fresh.

#### What Changed

- Toast messages show progress: "Analyserar..." → "Analys klar: [category]"
- OCR text section added to document detail (expandable, selectable text)

### 📋 "Got a Request" — Create Quotes from What Happened?

The "What happened?" flow now includes a 6th option: **Got a Request**. When a customer asks for a quote, tap it and go straight to creating one. Quotes are also no longer a separate tab at the bottom — they live under Jobs alongside Customers, Invoices, and Documents.
