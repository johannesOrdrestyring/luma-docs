# Our Vision

> **Less admin for small trades businesses — give business owners their evenings back.**

---

## What Makes Luma Different?

**Luma is not an ERP.**
**Luma is a digital business helper that happens to do ERP.**

That means:
- **Event-based** ("something happened"), not structure-based
- **Guided**, not configurable
- **Mobile-first**, one-hand, few taps
- **AI suggests next steps** — users never have to think

> If the user ever wonders "what do I do now?" — we have failed.

## Our Values

### 🚐 Built for the van, not the office

Luma is designed for people on the move, not behind a desk. Mobile-first. One hand. Few taps. Done.

**Result:** Work gets registered when it happens, not two days later.

---

### 💸 Invoice in seconds, get paid fast

Few clicks and then invoice. Smooth payment solutions make your customers pay faster.

**Result:** Invoice and get your money as soon as the job is done.

---

### ✅ Feel in control, without being a control freak

Everything important, nothing unnecessary.

**Result:** Calm. Confidence. Less mental load.

---

### 📎 Admin that disappears

Luma doesn't "help you manage admin" — it removes it. Log the work once. AI handles the rest.

**Result:** Less typing. Less forgetting. Less swearing.

---

### 💰 Know your money without touching accounting

Real-time financial overview without opening Fortnox or speaking accountant.

**Result:** You know if you're making money, today, not next quarter.

---

### 🌙 Get your evenings back

No more "I'll do the admin tonight". Luma already did it.

**Result:** Time for family, gym, or doing absolutely nothing.

---

### 💬 "ERP" without ERP language

No "modules", "ledgers" or "workflows". Just: We bought something. We did the work. We got paid.

**Result:** Anyone can use it. No training needed.

## The Five Core Flows

Everything in Luma starts with one question: **"What happened?"**

### 1. "I did a job"
Log who, what, how long. Luma prepares the invoice.

### 2. "I bought something"
Snap a receipt. Luma reads it and links it to a job.

### 3. "I got paid"
Mark payment received (or let Luma detect it automatically).

### 4. "I need to remember something"
Voice note or quick text. Luma reminds you later.

### 5. "Help me"
Ask Luma what to do next. Get AI-powered suggestions.
